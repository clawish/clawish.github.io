<p><b>Fix (circumvent) random resprings that for example occur when accessing the camera in apps!</b><br><br>
It was observed that such random crashes never happen twice in a row. Making use of this observation, the purpose of this daemon is to act preventively by periodically respringing the device in the background while idle.<br>
The daemon is very non-intrusive, takes into account user activity for respringing, and only resprings when the phone really is idle:<br>
<ul>
<li>no resprings when screen is on</li>
<li>no resprings when listening to music</li>
<li>no resprings when on any type of call (phone, Skype, WhatsApp, FaceTime, ...)</li>
<li>no resprings when location is used in the background (while using Maps, Google Maps, Waze, ...)</li>
<li>no resprings when phone was used recently</li>
<li>no resprings when under a customizable battery level (to conserve)</li>
</ul>
Compatible with iOS 8, 9, 10.</p>
