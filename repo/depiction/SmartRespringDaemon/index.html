<!-- <b style="font-size: 14pt;">Please kill the process SmartRespringDaemon after upgrading from 0.0.4 to 0.0.5. This can be done by REBOOTING for example.</b><br><br> -->
<p><b>Prevent random resprings that for example occur when accessing the camera in apps!</b><br><br>
It was observed that such random crashes never happen twice in a row. Making use of this observation, the purpose of this daemon is to act preventively by periodically respringing the device in the background while idle.<br>
The daemon is very non-intrusive, takes into account user activity for respringing, and only resprings when the phone really is idle:<br>
<ul>
<li>no resprings when screen is on</li>
<li>no resprings when listening to music (only resprings when Don't Stop The Party is installed)</li>
<li>no resprings when on any type of call (phone, Skype, WhatsApp, FaceTime, ...)</li>
<li>no resprings when location is used in the background (while using Maps, Google Maps, Waze, ...)</li>
<li>no resprings when phone was used recently</li>
<li>no resprings when under a customizable battery level (to conserve)</li>
</ul>
Compatible with iOS 8, 9, 10.<br>Customizable from Settings.<br><br>

Changelog:<br>
0.0.6 Fixed a bug where the daemon would not respring when in airplane mode<br>
0.0.5 Rewritten code. SmartRespringDaemon is now a SpringBoard tweak. Added Don't Stop The Party (not Lite) compatibility<br>
0.0.4 Reverted Don't Stop The Party compatibility since there are issues with resprings during calls<br>
0.0.3 Don't Stop The Party (not Lite) compatibility<br>
0.0.2 Initial release
