Description: Intelligently respring the device in background
 Fix (circumvent) random resprings that for example occur when accessing the camera in apps!
 It was observed that such random crashes never happen twice in a row. Making use of this observation, the purpose of this daemon is to act preventively by periodically respringing the device in the background while idle.
 The daemon takes into account user activity for respringing, and only resprings when the phone really is idle:
 - no resprings when screen is on
 - no resprings when listening to music
 - no resprings when on any type of call (phone, Skype, WhatsApp, FaceTime, ...)
 - no resprings when location is used in the background (while using Maps, Google Maps, Waze, ...)
 - no resprings when phone was used recently
 - no resprings when under a customizable battery level (to conserve)
 Compatible with iOS 8, 9, 10.
