Description: Intelligently respring the device in background
 Prevent random resprings that for example occur when accessing the camera in apps!
 It was observed that such random crashes never happen twice in a row. Making use of this observation, the purpose of this daemon is to act preventively by periodically respringing the device in the background while idle.
 The daemon is very non-intrusive, takes into account user activity for respringing, and only resprings when the phone really is idle:
 - no resprings when screen is on
 - no resprings when listening to music
 - no resprings when on any type of call (phone, Skype, WhatsApp, FaceTime, ...)
 - no resprings when location is used in the background (while using Maps, Google Maps, Waze, ...)
 - no resprings when phone was used recently
 - no resprings when under a customizable battery level (to conserve)
 Compatible with iOS 8, 9, 10.
